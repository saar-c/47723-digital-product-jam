# Template: Profile Page

This project implements a very simple HTML page. It is intended to demonstrate the minimum requirements to create a website, modify and serve it locally, and then deploy it to a public URL.

# Install Dependencies

There is a single dependency for this project - the Node `live-server` package. This simply serves the files at the root of the repository, and performs automatic reloads in the browser if a file changes, so changes are always visible. As long as you have Node installed, you can run the following command to install the dependencies for this project.

```
npm install
```

# Run the server

Once the project dependencies are installed, you can run the following command to serve the files of the project. What this essentially means is that a process will be run that serves the `index.html` file from the *root* of a URL.

```
npm start
```

# View in browser

With the server running you can open your browser and type the server URL into the address bar:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8080
```
